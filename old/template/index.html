          Artwork brings harmony and connects us to the soul of society. Artworks play a critical role in building a
          peaceful,
          creative and harmonious society. Indian states are blessed with a rich legacy of artforms. Several artists
          have played
          pivotal roles in promoting these artforms.</p>
        <p>
          India has a rich heritage of artforms. Every artwork has its own beautiful story. These stories date back to
          1000-2000
          years old. We can pass this story to our next generation by observing the work of artisans. There is a
          belief
          that
          Madhubani paintings originated from Sita's wedding. The painting uses handmade products: turmeric, banyan
          leaf, milk,
          indigo, kusum flower, green leaf of the applewood tree etc.</p>

        <p>
          India has a rich diversity of artforms or artworks. Each art form reflects the ethos and thought process of
          society of<br>
          that time. When we bring art product of handmade artforms, we bring great heritage and story to our house.
          These<br>
          stories
          can pass on to our generations.</p>
